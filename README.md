# Electoral Integrity â€” Minimal site

This branch provides a minimal site with an About page (index.html) and a single working-paper view (paper.html) that renders `paper.md`.

How to preview locally:
- From repository root run:
  - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
  - or: `npx http-server -p 8000`
- Open: http://localhost:8000

How to publish on GitHub Pages:
- Merge the factory-reset-about branch to the branch you want to publish (main), then enable Pages in repository settings (serve from the root).
- Alternatively, set Pages to serve from the factory-reset-about branch.

Notes:
- The renderer uses marked.js via CDN; if your environment blocks the CDN, add a local `assets/marked.min.js` file.
- If you want PDF generation from `paper.md` automatically, I can add a GitHub Actions workflow to produce `paper.pdf`.

## Abstract

A concise abstract (150–250 words) describing the purpose, data, methods, main findings, and implications. This working paper explores how institutions commonly described as the "fourth branch" (administrative agencies, electoral management bodies, judicial actors, or oversight institutions) influence electoral integrity outcomes. We use cross-national administrative data, original event datasets, and semi-structured interviews. Our main finding is that variation in administrative independence and procedural transparency significantly predicts lower incidence of irregularities, conditional on political competition.

**Keywords:** electoral integrity, administrative state, elections, comparative politics, institutions

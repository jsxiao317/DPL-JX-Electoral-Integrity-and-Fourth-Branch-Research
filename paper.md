## Abstract

This working paper explores how institutions commonly conceptualised as the "fourth branch" (administrative agencies, electoral management bodies, judicial actors or oversight institutions) influence electoral integrity outcomes. This paper posits the institutionalisation of electoral integrity units or EMBs as a 'fourth branch' elicits both supply-
side (reducing direct fraud) and demand-side (increasing voter confidence; reducing false narrative efficacy) effects. Using cross-national observational data (V-Dem, NELDA etc.) datasets (2000-2025), we devised comparative statistical analysis (chi-square & multi-level). Our methodological framework exemplifies both intra-country and inter-country
correlation between EMB transparency and outcomes of fraud incidence (H1) or voter confidence in results (H2). Leveraging natural variation in institutional transparency, our approach partitions variance into structural (cross-national) and temporal components to identify consistent, systematic patterns of co-variation. The correlations, given constraints in causal inferences, provide rigorous empirical ground to this paper’s supply-side and demand-side hypotheses.

## 1. Introduction (Working 13/12/2025)

The dawn of populism amid the polarised twenty-first century has perpetuated two distinct threats to electoral integrity in liberal democracies: direct procedural manipulation and post-election contestation via weaponising false fraud claims. The latter, evident in recent U.S. and Brazilian elections, characterises the delegitimisation of elections by populist actors who exploit the vulnerabilities of the tripartite branches (legislative, executive, judiciary) – the lack of depoliticised institutions to verify electoral results. Addressing its structural and adjudicative limits, this paper advances a ‘fourth branch’ institutional theory. Conceptualised and taxonomised by Tushnet (2020) and Ackerman (2000), our ‘fourth branch’ synthesises Pal’s (2016) institutionalisation of electoral management bodies (EMBs) with Norris’s (2015) electoral cycle integrity theory to propose a constitutionally-sourced, publicly-anchored institution. It is continuous, transparent and autonomous from government – dedicated to preserving electoral integrity. 

Our paper posits that the institutionalisation of electoral integrity means as a functionally equivalent ‘fourth branch’ of government measurably depresses electoral fraud, cements legitimacy and conduces higher voter acceptance of election results. We assert that the institutional framework of the ‘fourth branch’ provides both supply-side and demand-side effects: the former bars direct electoral fraud by fostering a robust and transparent mechanism; the latter positively [goes out of the way to] strengthen perceptions of electoral legitimacy, eroding political capital for populist actors to push rhetorics and narratives of fraud.

Equally, we normatively contend that an acting ‘fourth branch’, responsible for securing electoral integrity mechanisms, is foundationally crucial to the future function of liberal democracies. We cite the Bolivian Election of 2019 and 2025 and its parallels to the US 2020 Presidential Election, among other comparative scenarios in this paper, to evidence our prescription of a nuanced ‘fourth branch’ constitutional design. Indeed, this paper postulates and explores how an independent, civil, non-governmentally bound and nonpartisan institution reinforces the supply-side and demand-side empirical framework established.

## 2. Theory and Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1 – Supply-Side** - Prevention of electoral fraud
*We hypothesise that an independent election administration operating as a ‘fourth branch’ of government, alongside the executive, legislative and the judiciary, reduces the frequency and susceptibility of elections to fraud.*

**Hypothesis 2 - Demand-Side** - Legitimacy; Voter Confidence & Acceptance
*We hypothesise that a transparent and secure election mechanisms, enabled by the aforementioned ‘fourth branch’, will restore public trust in electoral legitimacy, thereby barring the effectiveness of fraudulent claims by popular opportunists on the public and measurably increasing acceptance of results.*

### 2.1. Supply-Side Mechanism

– outright measure

(1) the supply-side measurably reduces direct electoral fraud by fostering robust mechanisms;

### 2.2. Demand-Side Mechanism

- ripple & extended measure

(2) the demand-side ensures the provision of epistemic transparency via publicly verifiable facts, thereby inoculating democracies against delegitimisation.
